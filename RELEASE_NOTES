# Version 0.3.8
################################################################################

The file structure for the non-host reads has changed in this version, so that, upon rerun, the pipeline 
will most likely regenerate the entire workflow, when you ran it prior to this release on your data. To 
avoid that behavior, you would first need to run the preprocess__bowtie2 rules like this

bash run_Pipeline-Holoruminant-meta.sh preprocess__bowtie2

to generate a the new files from the structe (and also get the quantification for the chromosomes) followed by 

bash run_Pipeline-Holoruminant-meta.sh --touch 

to adjust the files to the new structe. After that, the pipeline should be again aware of the files.

And as always, newer start the pipline without a dry-run after an update on an existing project!!!
