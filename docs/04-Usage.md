# Usage
The pipeline can run the entire workflow at once. However, normally it is recommended to run different modules from the pipeline separated to get better control over the results and also to be able to react quicker to possible errors.

In the following it is assumed that the pipeline runs on a server that utilizes SLURM and Singularity. Other setups are also supported, but currently untested. In case you have a different setup and want to contribute a profile/configuration, please reach out.

For testing and developing, you can add to every command e.g. the option `-np` for a dry-run that prints the used commands.

The different module have also individual reports that can be generated by adding `report_` in front of the module name, when a module is called. However, the reports are currently under developments and do not produce any reasonable output and might crash even.

## 'reads-module'
Here some basic steps for the reads are performed.

Usage:

```
bash run_Pipeline-Holoruminant-meta.sh reads

# Generate the module report
bash run_Pipeline-Holoruminant-meta.sh report_reads
```

For testing, please check first the dry-run with commands printed by running the command like this

```
bash run_Pipeline-Holoruminant-meta.sh reads -np
```

For all other modules this works in a similar fashion, just add the `-np`-option for testing and `report_` to the module to generate a report for the module (not implemented yet for all modules).
