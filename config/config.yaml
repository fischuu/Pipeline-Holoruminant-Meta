 # This node is used for setting up a ramdisc for time-critical tasks. Make sure, that the allocation ensures that the entire node is
 # requested for the job so that there won't be other users on the same node while the job runs. Their jobs might get affected by the
 # /dev/shm access that is happening for rules using this resource_set!
 # In case you do not want to (or cannot) use /dev/shm please define a different file path in config/config.yaml under "shm_storage"
