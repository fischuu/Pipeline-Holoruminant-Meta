# CHANGELOG
##############

Version 0.3.*:
--------------
51: Quantification is now part of the rule all
50: Cosmetic changes for the escalation setting
49: Fixed a bug that prevented a dryrun to run while escalating resources were defined
48: Added the singularity-prefix to the run script
47: Added resource sets, resource escalation functions and retries (trial in helpers__fastqc)
46: Sylph for contigs and mags removed for now
45: DRAM distill input fixed, annotation had wrong scaffold entry so output was too strongly condensed
44: Sylp added to annotate module
43: contig_annotate__sylp added
42: preprocess__sylph added
41: --keep-going added as default option to run the pipeline
40: Order of the host decontamination changed, to avoid sequence similarity problems between different genomes
39: Hard-coded threads in reference__hosts__recompress changed to variable
39: Added the missing proteinortho files to be moved into result folder
38: Fixed the output for proteinortho
37: Output for DRAM_mag rule adjusted
36: Function names for bowtie rules harmonised
35: Function call to contig_annotate__prodigal improved
34: Optional Debug comments added to the Snakefile
33: DRAM mag rules added
32: Adjusted the Output ruleset for contig_annotate__camper and moved from folder to concrete files
31: Apply proteinortho now on the set of proteins obtains from the different MAG sets
30: Added bakta annotation for each MAG separately instead of applying it to one dereplicated MAG-set only
29: Summary tables for Diamond added
28: Bowtie2 and Humann2 were moved to own docker container 
27: Added camper to contig_annotate
26: Names of many rules were adjusted to follow a similary naming scheme
25: Krona got an own singularity image, as it downversion bowtie2 in the same image for some reason
24: Re-enabled the splif-fasta for proteinortho input
23: Krona plots added for kraken2
22: Eggnog does not throw an error anymore in case that no fast nvme tmp folder is provided
21: Added the camper module to annotate
20: In annotate/GTDB-TK the annot and classify folders won't be deleted anymore
19: Sylph added
18: Added a new proteinortho rule that takes entire bakta output as input, not splitted
17: More nvme memory to eggnog assigned
16: Added the --skip-plot option as default to Bakta to prevent error for large MAGs (needs to be re-added later as separate step)
15: Protect the eggnog logs that they are not deleted in case of an error (could be removed after trouble shooting)
14: Added a config path to phylophlan
13: Changed bug in rule phylophlan -e was changed to --genome_extension
12: bakta uses now per default the option "--skip-crispr", as there was some unsolveable error with it (error code -6)
11: Time resource allocation for assemble_drep adjusted
10: Removed redundant rule calls from contig_assemble and avoid rerunning rules for already existing files
9: Preprocess rule output adjusted, to account for temp files
8: Decontaminated reads are now stored in a dedicated locations and other host/non-host reads are removed
7: Chromosome-wise quantification for host genomes added
6: Temporary output is now by default removed from HumanN 
5: Software requirements adjusted for installations
4: Added dedicated TMPDIR definitions to rules preprocess/ humann, metaphlan, nonpareil and singlem
3: Changed in _contigAnnotate__prodiga  sed to grep, to satisfy linter
2: Linter warnings fixed
1: Developer version (this version is similar to 0.2)

Version 0.2: First public release version (18.09.2024)
