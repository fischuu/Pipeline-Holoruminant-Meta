CHANGELOG

Version 0.1.*:

5: Updated gatk docker image to 0.3 (contains GATK 2.4.0), to work together with data release 220
4: In megahit, maxbin2 and metabat, you can now adjust the minimum contig length to be kept, avoid tools bias
3: HUMAnN runs no in multithreading mode
2: protein/nucleotide database mixup in the HUMAnN rule fixed
1: In rule rule _preprocess__fastp__run the bgzip is now separate (instead of piping) for better trouble shooting
